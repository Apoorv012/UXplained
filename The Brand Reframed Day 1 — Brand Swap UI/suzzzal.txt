Swiggy → Zomato
(Swiggy app redesigned with Zomato’s UI style)

I changed the Swiggy app and made it look like the Zomato app.
Now the app has bright red colors, so it looks fun and easy to notice.
The first screen and login page are very simple, so people don’t get confused.
The buttons are big and clear, so it’s easy to tap and use.
When you open the home screen, the food pictures look yummy and neat, just like Zomato.
It still feels like Swiggy, but now it looks like Zomato is wearing Swiggy’s clothes :)
